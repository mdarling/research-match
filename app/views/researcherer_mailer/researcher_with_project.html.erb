<h3>Hello <%= @researcher.first_name %>,</h3>
<br>

<p><b>Thank you for participating in the beta testing of UNM Research match.  The system is now fully operational! We have updated and simplified the process.  Please login at http://research-match.unm.edu to view your project and make any necessary updates. We apologize for the length of time it took to officially launch the site. The Research Match database project was presented at the Deansâ€™ Council last Thursday and a press release will be issued in a couple of weeks.  
 The step by step instruction guide is attached. If you have any questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:researchmatch@unm.edu?Subject=Question About Research Matching System." target="_top">researchmatch@unm.edu</a>.</b></p>

<br />
<h4>Have a nice day,<br>
The UNM Research-Match Team.</h4>
